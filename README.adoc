:url-repo: https://gitlab.com/opendevise/oss/antora-navigator-extension

An Antora extension that exports the navigation data to JavaScript so the navigation tree can be built in the browser.

WARNING: This is alpha software!
That means the extension is experimental and likely to change at any time without notice.
You're free to test it and give feedback, but take caution when relying on it in a production site.
