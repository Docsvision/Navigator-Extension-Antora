= Antora Navigator Demo

This example provides a demonstration for how to use this extension with a site that uses the default UI (or a derivative of it).
If you've already cloned this repository, you can run it using the following command:

 $ npx antora antora-playbook.yml

If you haven't yet cloned the repository, use these steps instead:

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/opendevise/oss/antora-navigator-extension.git
   cd antora-navigator-extension
   npm ci
   cd example
   npx antora antora-playbook.yml

Since this extension is still experimental, you'll notice that some assembly is still required.
