= Antora Navigator Demo

This example provides a demonstration for how to use this extension with a site that uses the default UI (or a derivative of it).
You can run it using the following command:

 $ npx antora antora-playbook.yml

Since this extension is still experimental, you'll notice that some assembly is still required.
